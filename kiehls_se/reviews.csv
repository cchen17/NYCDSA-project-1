5,Nashville! Tn,2012-09-05,A must have basic...,,"I have been using this moisturizer on and off for years. Does just what it says it will...completely hydrates your skin in one application without feeling greasy. It absorbs quickly & is a great basic moisturizer. Regardless of what I use, I always seem to come back to this one moisturizer! Definitely a keeper in your skincare regime!"
4,NY,2018-10-04,Prod test october,,Very nice product specially for middle age females
5,,2018-09-24,I absolutely love this moisturizer!,,I have used many facial moisturizers without ever being impressed. This impressed me it makes my skin soft and keeps my skin moisturized all day. It doesn't have any greasy feeling and is working perfectly with my combination skin. Definitely will be repurchasing!! <3
5,"New York, NY",2018-09-17,A necessity,,"This week, I learned just how great Kiehls moisturizer works (and that my skin might be addicted to it!) I ran out of my deluxe-size moisturizer while on my honeymoon in Spain. Afterward, my skin became so dry and was actually peeling. I used my husband’s cheap, pharmacy moisturizer but it didn’t do anything for me. Fortunately, I was able to locate a Kiehls in Barcelona and purchased the facial cream. The instant I put it in, my skin was back to “normal.” SO beyond thankful I was able to find a location abroad and very thankful for the moisturizing power of Kiehls!!"
5,,2018-08-24,Awesome For Combination Skin,,I love this moisturizer after applying it gives me a nice glow that isn’t heavy or cakey on my skin. I will be purchasing again!
5,,2018-08-13,,,Can't beat this moisturizer! It is the perfect balance of hydration but not too much where my face gets oily. I use morning and night.
5,New York,2018-07-26,GOTTA HAVE IT,no bad,Nice product. I will recommend this to my friends.
5,"Alexandria, MN",2018-07-24,Great for Dry Winter Skin,,"I normally don’t even write reviews but I moved to Minnesota and my skin is so dry during the winter it cracks and flakes. This was a lifesaver it kept my skin soft and hydrated after one application at night after the shower. Goes on light and absorbs quickly, love the texture. I have sensitive skin and get a rash from a lot of lotions and this one had no reaction. It’s summer now and I still use it every night, great product."
5,"San Diego, CA",2018-07-22,Cure for everything,,I had very oily skin and am acne prone. I thought that this might help keep my skin moisturized and hydrated while using all my drying acne products and I was right! I don’t have oily skin anymore and my acne has decreased! This was the best purchase and the large container lasts for weeks!
5,"Chicago, IL, USA",2018-07-20,No Regrets,Expensive,"I have been struggling with an extremely dry face in the winter months and I've experimented (and wasted money) on many different moisturizers. Finally I came across this one! Right away my dry skin went away. I would moisturize in the AM and by nighttime my face would still be moisturized! I was so happy with the results and I will recommend this product to anyone. Additionally, I have very sensitive acne prone skin but this moisturizer does not cause any problems. Thanks Kiehl's :)"
5,"Portland, ME, USA",2018-07-18,This Cream is Wonderful!,,"I recently completed chemo and radiation therapy and my skin was so dried out I didn't think it would ever feel like skin again. Thanks to Kiehl's , and especially this face cream I am finally getting my
pre-treatment skin back. I recommend highly!"
5,"Minneapolis, MN, USA",2018-07-16,Swear by this,,"This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever purchased. I use this daily, and it spreads nicely and is very light. Apply in the morning and it will last you all day. Apply at night and your skin wakes up very refreshed."
3,Tijuana Mexico,2018-07-13,ITS NOT FOR ALL TYPES SKIN!!!!,,My skin is mix and i bought this product because i read the cream is a básic and is for all types skin but ......is too oily!!!! My skin ir was like a lamp and i cant out my makeover
5,"New York, NY",2018-06-27,Great Moisturizer!,,"I love this moisturizer it's very soothing to my skin. I use it in the morning and at night and notice a glow. Definitely would recommend to anyone, even with sensitive skin!"
3,Georgia,2018-06-24,Kiehl’s Has Better Products,,"I would say about 90% of my skin care routine is Kiehl’s. I’ve personally tried MANY of their products & find the “Ultra” line to be lacking. The Ultra Moisterizer feels like the “discount” version of the more expensive Kiehl’s moisturizers. I would use it if I ran out of Super Multi-Corrective Cream or Rosa Arctica, but I’d prefer to not resort to it. It doesn’t absorb as well, leaves the skin not as smooth and light, & has a tendency to make the skin too oily."
5,"Oakland, CA",2018-06-16,Standard,,This is among the products that I consider standard and will always have in stock. I keep a full size in my cabinet and a sample size that I refill in my bag!
5,"Buda, TX 78610, USA",2018-06-05,Best Moisturizer ever for sensitive skin,wish it was cheaper,"I love this moisturizer. I have not been able to use anything else that wont burn me. I have tried ole henrickson. este lauder, MAC, Dr Murad, and the list keeps going. IT also is not greasy at all."
5,"Los Angeles, CA",2018-05-30,Best Moisturizer Ever!!!,,First off I never write reviews but this moisturizer has amazed me so much!!! I’m on my second jar and I’ve seen so much change in my skin tone. My skin is smoother and it has prevented my occasional breakouts. It’s so amazing definitely a life changer.
5,"League City, TX",2018-05-29,Great for my aging skin,,I love that it has no scent. My face soaks it up and feels nice and smooth after applying. Great for after sun care.
5,,2018-05-18,,,"I have always had extremely sensitive skin and I am very acne prone. This is the only moisturizer I have ever used that leaves my skin feeling soft, not oily, and does not make me breakout. I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin since starting this product."
5,"Indianapolis, IN, USA",2018-05-17,LOVE this moisturizer,,"I have sensitive combination skin, and this moisturizer is perfect for my skin during all times of the year. Great silky texture - not greasy and seeps into your skin well."
4,Ma,2018-05-12,Has the formula changed?,,"I’ve been been using this cream on and off for years. I have always loved it and go back to it. I just bought some at Sephora after a year of NOT using it and it has a slight smell to it, one I have never noticed before and definitely don’t care for. Has the formula changed??"
1,,2018-05-06,extremely disappointed,,"I liked Kielhs before. but after I use this product and the Calendula toner, my skin has become dry than ever. I had to use other products to fix the dryness. When my skin got better, I tried this cream again, still does not work at all. also, I don't know if it's due to the product, I even got big pores.
I am very disappointed"
5,,2018-04-25,Ultra Results,,"I actually got this as a sample from BirchBox a month ago and I have already purchased the full size because this is amazing stuff. I am 30 and starting to see fine lines and crows feet by my eyes, or I WAS I should say. Since I started using this I have noticed a remarkable difference in my skin. I would highly recommend to anyone that needs the all in one moisturizer. Love this stuff!!!!!!!!"
4,"Las Vegas, NV",2018-04-22,Please make it better,,I have used this cream for 5 years. It is really moisturize my skin. Everything is perfect but one ingredient PROPYLPARABEN bother me. Please don't use it anymore. PLEASE!
5,,2018-04-12,best moisturizer,,I have never been able to use a moisturizer with out breaking out this has been the best purchase
5,"Pawling, Ny",2018-04-07,Holy Grail of moisturizers!,there is no con! :),"I am so in love with this moisturizer!! I’m 49 years old and I so wish I discovered this years ago. I have a moisturizer graveyard of all the products I’ve tried through the years. My best friend is an esthetician and has given me so many samples to try for my dry skin, to no avail. This has now become my favorite product ever! My face is truly moisturized all day, and it feels hydrated up until I go to bed. It really is unbelievable and I’m giving all my younger girlfriends a sample so they can discover it before they are 49 (lol). Thank you Kiehls!"
2,Chicago,2018-04-05,Everything is going ok... but then there's the smell,smell,"This seems to moisturized ok at night, a little too thick for the day time. My face has some slight irritation but not every night. the thing that I really hate about this product is... IT SMELLS LIKE JET FUEL! I put on this lovely scented midnight recovery concentrate and then bury the smell with fumes. not pleasant to smell when I lay my face on my pillow. overall disappointed with this product."
5,"Cleveland, Ohio",2018-04-04,Favorite Moisturizer!,,"I have gone through about 5-8 large jars of this moisturizer. I have started using it during the day, and the arctic one during the night since it is thicker. I love that this makes my skin feel soft, but does not look greasy. I have normal/dry skin, and live in Ohio so it gets pretty dry in the winter due to the cold. I would have patches on my face peeling off and make up cracking because it was so dry, but then I was turned onto using this and never has happened after that. I do not like the smell of sunscreen, so I don't use the one with SPF, instead I mix a sunscreen I own into a drop of this. I layer all my products and then go over with this moisturizer. I definitely recommend this!"
5,"Nashville, TN, USA",2018-03-27,Love this moisturizer!,,I have tried so many moisturizers over the years to find one that will moisturize my skin without it feeling greasy and this is the perfect one! A little bit goes a long way as it absorbs into the skin and makes it feel nourished and not greasy! Love this stuff and you get so much for the price!
3,,2018-03-22,It's Good for winter,,I am using '' Ultra Facial Cream '' which is good in winter but it really making me sweating and uncomfortable.
5,"New York, NY",2018-03-21,My Favorite Product!,,I absolutely swear by this face cream! It is the best and I have seen such a difference in my skin since I started using it! Highly recommend for anyone!
5,minneapolis,2018-03-16,Feeling Flawless!,,The moment this product touches my skin I can't help but smile just a bit. This moisturizer is absolutely incredible and something I look forward to using everyday!
2,"Kings Mountain, NC",2018-03-15,Disappointing product,,"It does not moisturize all night. Seems like it is water down and goes on your face smoothly, but it just disappears. I won't buy it again."
1,"Chicago, IL",2018-03-01,That smell..what did they change???,,"I've been using Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream for years and have always been very satisfied. I received my most recent purchase earlier this month (Feb.2018) and noticed a definite change in this product.
The smell, as soon as you apply Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream,is awful.The only way I can describe it is very similar to a heavy ""scent of motor oil."" I don't know if they've changed the formula, but it's not even usable (unless, you really like the smell of motor oil). Good luck. My previous 4 star rating down to 1."
5,Puerto Rico,2018-03-01,Best Cream Ever,no cons :),"My boyfriend gave me this cream and I love it Lleaves the skin soft and nourished and is lightweight to use before makeup. And very important any person with any kind of skin type can use it, I have oily skin and works great on my face. love love love <3"
5,"Boston, MA, USA",2018-02-22,Perfect moisturizer,,"This is the quintessential moisturizer. It does what it says: it softens the skin. Somehow, no matter what the season or what my skin is doing, it always gives the right amount of moisture. I prefer a moisturizer to do just that, and apply my anti-aging stuff as serums underneath. It feels refreshing and cushioning on the face, it's a pleasure to apply, and it's simply perfect. I wouldn't recommend it for ultra dry skin, but sensitive/norma/normal to oily/normal to dry could all benefit from this simple formulation."
3,Croatia,2018-02-22,It’s ok,,This the first khiels product that I bought. I don’t really understand why it’s best seller. Khiels has so much more better product. Cream is ok but nothing special
3,,2018-02-21,Different smell,awful smell,I’ve been using this particular facial moisturizer for the last couple of years. I absolutely love it. However I just re ordered it and something has changed. It use to be pretty much odorless and now has almost a burnt plastic or rubber smell to it. It’s not very pleasant and would stop me from purchasing this item even though it is the same texture and thickness.
5,Rhode Island,2018-02-19,First Time User of ultra facial cream,no con,"My granddaughter gave me a jar of this facial cream for Christmas, I'm more than half finished with the cream & just ordered another so I will not run out."
5,,2018-01-29,I listened to my sister and I am glad I did!,,"I had other facial creams from Kiehl's and also from high brands such as Estee Lauder and Kate Somerville. But honestly all the other creams that I have tried just can't relate to this cream. I love it so much. It makes my face fully hydrated and plump and seriously no joke, my skin is much clearer from just using this cream. I have bad acne and blackheads and this cream literally solved all my problems. Couldn't be happier."
5,,2018-01-26,The real deal,,"Best moisturizer I've used, and I have gone through a bunch. Really penetrates the skin and has a lasting, hydrating effect. My skin has never looked better."
4,,2018-01-24,Love but,,"I always come back to this moisturizer, but this last purchase, about a week ago, has a very weird smell. I figured the formula had changed but I saw that someone else commented on the same thing."
5,Texas,2018-01-23,Perfect for dry winter skin,,"After dealing with some serious dry skin issues from some bad makeup, I turned to Kiehl's to help repair my sad skin. The Ultra Facial Cream was the first product I tried and it's become a twice-daily part of my skincare routine. I use it in the morning after cleansing and in the evening as a last step after my serum. I sometimes even smooth a little over dry areas before going outside for a cool weather run in the colder months, just to keep my skin hydrated. If you have really dry skin (like me) try mixing in a few drops of a facial oil for added moisture."
5,"Chicago, IL",2018-01-22,Absolute favorite moisturizer ever!,,A little goes a long way and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and replenished. I got this as a sample once and after the first use I knew I had to go back and get more. It lives up to its name because it is definitely ultra moisturizing!
2,santa monica CA,2018-01-17,something has changed,,I've been using this cream for years.
2,Bonita springs Florida,2018-01-14,Laurie,,"I have always liked this cream but the last jar I received smells very unusual, did you change the formula?"
5,,2017-12-28,Seriously love this,,"This has many purposes. I can use only this, or I can put this under my foundation in exchange for using a primer. It doesn't move my makeup around on my face and it smells great too. I got it orignally in a little sample but i'm already about to order the jar because it's THAT good. Along with the facial oil (not sure what it's called right off hand). They both are my go-to to use under my foundation. I no longer have to wear primer. Which is a huge plus. Also for the price of this jar, you get a lot. And a little goes a long way!"
1,,2017-12-26,Disappointed,,I was quite disappointed after trying this product. It is very oily and not smooth at all. I don't feel comfortable at all wearing this moisture. Now it is just staying there alone. It is really not worth this price.
5,NYC,2017-12-08,The best cream ever,,"I must say that this cream has changed the way my skin looks, feels, and breathes. I apply this cream day and night and my face glows through the day and I have noticed significant changes in the evening of the tone and overall health of my skin. I have finally found what my skin needs, loves and enjoys!"
5,,2017-11-30,The Perfect Moisturizer,,I love the Ultra Facial Cream! The texture is perfect and doesn't clog my pores.
5,Boston MA,2017-11-21,everyone should use this,none,"this is the first moisturizer i’ve ever used that does its job extremely well. it goes on and sinks in quickly and doesn’t leave a weird oily film on your face afterwards, nor does it get “sweaty” during the summertime. i use it on all of my clients as well as it makes a perfect base for makeup and doesn’t irritate sensitive skin."
5,"riverside, CA",2017-10-31,A miracle product!,,"I've never repurchased a facial product like I've been doing with this one. I absolutely fell in love with it. It's simple and yet effective enough to keep your skin hydrated and nourish it to the dewy and healthy-looking point! I grow up in another country, whose the weather is humid and tropical, cuz of that I never had an issue with dry skin and break-outs. But ever since I moved to the U.S., the dry weather here breaks me out so bad and my skin constantly gets dry after showering. However, this product is the best thing ever happens to me! It helps keep my skin hydrated, all the flakes as well as pimples are gone now. I also notice a difference in the appearance of my skin overall! I would keep repurchasing this product in the future!"
4,,2017-10-10,don't like the smell,,"I think overall is fine, but I don't like the smell. not sure how well it works, will have to wait and see."
5,"Detroit, MI",2017-08-21,Best Ever!,,"Never have I used a moisturizer like this before. It absorbs into my skin so quickly and I can actually feel my skin soaking it in. It doesn't just sit on the surface. My skin feels so healthy! I can't imagine ever using a different product. Kiehl's makes the best skin and hair care products I have ever used, and I've been through my fair share! So happy I'm not wasting money on ineffective products anymore. Kiehl's provides a product that is worth far beyond the price listed."
5,,2017-07-20,10/10 Best moisturizer,runs out faster than anticipated,"A truly 24-hr face moisturizer. Non-greasy, fast absorbing. I used it in all four seasons. Day and Night. Keep my face hydrated the whole day without having to reapply. It lasted for about 8 months, which I guess isn't so bad but I had to admit - it ran out faster than I had anticipated. But nonetheless, I would absolutely recommend this to anybody."
5,Pennsylvania,2017-04-30,The Best,,"My favorite moisturizer! It is very hydrating and lightweight. I use three products (cleanser, toner and the cream) from this collection. The result: my skin is hydrated and radiant everyday. They are all fabulous products (I feel like the cream works best when it is used with the other two together) but the cream is my personal favorite. I also apply the cream immediately after using a sheet mask at night - it helps lock the hydration."
5,Atlanta,2017-04-24,The best moisturizer,,"This is, by far, the best moisturizer I've ever tried. A little goes a long way. It's made my skin feel moisturized, it's evenly toned and it just feels great!! Will never use another moisturizer."
5,"Cheyenne, WY",2017-04-14,"Best moisturizer I've ever used, and I've tried many!",,"This moisturizer may have very well changed my life. I have fair, freckled skin that reacts poorly to changes in the weather. I live in a very dry midwest climate and often experience flaking and itchy dry patches on my face that never seem to mend. And trust me, I've tried A LOT of moisturizers. I can easily say dryness is my most frustrating continual skin problem. This is solving it! I just tried this moisturizer for the first time last night and this morning all the flakiness is ALREADY gone. I'm super impressed! Packaging is nice – the lid screws on nicely – however I'm not totally happy with the value. It's a little bit of an investment. BUT WORTH IT!"
5,,2017-04-03,Love This Moisturizer,,"I have been using the Ultra Facial Cream for close to 6 years now. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and fresh with no sticky feeling. I have normal skin, but it can lean toward the dry side in the winter. This moisturizer is a year round must have."
5,"Chicago, IL",2017-03-18,Obsessed!!,,I am beyond happy with this moisturizer! It honestly is the best moisturizer I have ever used. A lot of moisturizers I have used either don't moisturize enough or make me feel oily but this one is absolutely perfect!!!
5,,2017-03-14,The Absolute Best,,"The. Best. Moisturizer. Ever. Very reasonable price for A TON of product. Thick and creamy but still light on the skin, looks great under makeup. This is a good moisturizer for those people who aren't playing games with their skincare and just want something very plain but very good. I'm going to try the Ultra Facial Moisture Balm and Ultra Facial Moisturizer now!"
3,,2017-03-07,"A good moisturizer, but not for oily skin",not for oily skin,"As a person with oily skin, I don't think product is the best. It is a good moisturizer and it does last all day. It feels like heavy lotion to me and makes my skin feel oilier. I think it would work for skin is dry to normal."
4,,2017-02-21,Solid Facial Lotion,,"A good facial moisturizer for night time or whenever you may use a cleanser that will dry your skin out. It is more suitable for the winter, where you would want a thicker lotion. Not much is needed so it should last you a while. No fragrance!"
5,"Chicago,IL",2017-02-18,Only moisturizer you need,,I have been looking for a moisturizer for years and feel like I have tried everything from top of the line products to drug store finds. I ordered the ultra facial cream after reading the reviews but admit I was skeptical. Needless to say I am thrilled with the results!!! After using it for only ONE day I can already see a difference. The winters in the Midwest are very drying & cold I am no longer concerned about keeping my skin hydrated & youthful looking after using this product. It is a must have!!
5,Los Angeles,2017-02-15,Best I have found,,"This cream is great for both day and night. Light weight, never greasy or oily. I never feel dry with this. My face glows. It's a must for me I have not been without it since. I love the glow I get from this and that it layers well on top of my kiehls oils I use. I am a skincare advocate and love taking care of my skin and this is the best cream I have tried. My face glows and it's so smooth. Thank u Kiehls!!!"
5,"New York, NY",2017-02-12,You need this in your routine,,"I first started using this moisturizer three years ago and always find myself coming back to it because it works so well for my sensitive skin. Sometimes when I wear mascara for days in a row my eyes will burn really bad when I put on moisturizer after washing my face. That never happens with this moisturizer. This moisturizer got me through Accutane, which was insanely drying for my skin. I've tried both the Ultra Facial Gel Cream and the Balm, but found this to be the perfect amount of moisture for me. Can't say enough good things about this product, it's so good!"
5,Montana,2017-02-09,Loved this product,,"I have tried so many moisturizer over the years! I have never found a moisture that I love this much! I get amazing moisture from this without any oily feeling. I have gone all winter long without dry skin,because of this amazing moisturizer! I am one very happy customer, with this product."
4,NY,2017-01-31,Hydrating but ocassionally stings face,,I have sensitive skin and I find this cream to ocassionally sting my face after I wash it with cleanser. It works fine most of the time however. Provides good hydration for the whole day and leaves my skin feeling soft.
5,,2017-01-22,moisturizing moisturizer,,"Very good and the best moisturizer I've ever used. I can see effect even I dont use it one day, but my face still soft and skin feels moisturized."
4,"Georgia, GA",2017-01-14,Perfect Product for skin,,"My face is brighter and has the healthy-looking because of this ""Ultra Facial Cream"". I have received a lot of compliments about my skin. Thank you Kiehl's for always helping me has the suitable products."
5,"Madison, GA",2017-01-09,Best Moisturizer Ever,,My sister recommended this moisturizer to me when I complained about my other moisturizers being too thick and oily. i like this moisturizer because it doesn't make me feel heavy or sticky when it's on my face. It has a nice texture and a little bit goes a long way.
5,,2017-01-07,Dry skin during pregnancy cured!,,"I was pregnant and came down with really dry skin. My face was so dry that I tried multiple moisturizers from the drug store, applied them multiple times per day, and my face was still dry. I found a recommendation for this on a forum and gave it a go. With one application my face was moisturized all day long. It really does work wonders. I haven't had issues with dry skin once the baby was born, but if the dry skin ever comes back this will definitely be a regular item in my cabinet!"
5,St. Louis,2016-12-30,Everyday Must,,"This cream is perfect for my combination skin. I could never find the right moisturizer, other brands' moisturizers make my skin oilier or don't moisturize well. A little goes a long way and keeps me hydrated all day long."
5,"Dallas, Tx",2016-12-21,Favorite Moisturizer Ever,,"I am a longtime fan of this moisturizer. I use it twice daily and it is a staple in my routine. My husband tried it one day and is hooked now too so we are going through it twice as fast, so I wish the price point was a little lower. It's light yet still very hydrating for my super dry skin. I am very sensitive to scented products and this one has a rather undetectable scent. I like that it is in a tub so I can get every last little dab of product out of the container. I never let myself run out of this product because for me it's a must-have. Highly recommend if you're looking for a lightweight, non-greasy, ultra-hydrating moisturizer."
5,CT,2016-12-19,Love,,"I am a first-time user and so far my skin is LOVING this moisturizer. I live in the Northeast, and can already tell that this will be my new winter moisturizer. Very moisturizing without clogging pores in my somewhat sensitive aging skin. It's a keeper!"
5,"Denver, CO",2016-12-18,The Best Moisturizer I've Ever Found!!!,,"I had been using this product for almost two years, until I moved and my skin started freaking out. I figured it was my facial products, so I did an overhaul for a few months. That made it way worse, so I've come back to my tried and true Ultra Facial products (cleanser, toner, and this cream), and will not be straying again anytime in the near future. Excellent products for the price and larger sizes literally last forever."
5,"Hilton Head, SC",2016-12-18,Amazing Product,,I seriously love this product! I could tell a huge difference after one night of using it! You must try this product!
5,"Dallas, TX",2016-12-12,Love it!,,"Got this as a gift from my dad who's a huge Kiehl's fan, so I'm not surprised it worked so well! The second I put it on my skin feels so much softer and continues to feel so throughout the entire day. The only reason I gave performance 4 stars and not 5 is because it takes a while to absorb."
5,,2016-12-04,The Core of my Skin Routine,,"Managing acne has been an endless challenge for me, mostly due to my extremely oily skin. I learned early on in life to never touch my face unless I wanted my self esteem crushed for 3-4 weeks. I ignored moisturizing in my routine as any creams I found would make me feel greasy before the morning was over. This resulted in a lovely dry flaky face early in the day followed by an oily afternoon of putting water on my face to evaporate off some moisture for temporary bliss every 30 minutes; I was only cleansing and not moisturizing."
5,,2016-12-02,Wonderful cream,,"I cannot rate effect and performance just yet because I just have started using this lotion. But what I can say: it is very lite, weightless, it does not make skin heavy, it does not leave residues or shiny look on the skin. It truly melts into the skin , and it feels wonderful. I have sensitive skin and skin which does not accept ANY heavy creams or lotions. In addition, this cream does not have any smell of perfume. I do not know if this cream will sustain its effect long term , but after 1 month I have no complains"
5,"Austin,TX",2016-11-28,Perfect,,"I have been searching for a good daily moisturizer that helps my dehydrated skin, without being greasy. I have been using the Clarins gel moisturizer, but found as the weather has become colder and more dry that I have to use excess just for my skin not to feel tight.
This is amazing.... hands down best I've used. And for the price?!?!? I can tell it will last me months, a little does a long way.
I thought i wouldn't like it initially because it felt very lotion-y, aka greasy, but I am amazed at how silky, plump and bright my skin looks. This is the first time it has ever looked hydrated without being greasy. I can't imagine my life without this now!"
5,"Baltimore, MD",2016-11-28,Great Moisturizer for Dry Skin,,"My skin gets very dry in the winter and this moisturizer is the best I've used. It is thick enough to make my skin feel very moisturized, but it's not oily or greasy even after wearing all day under makeup. I love it!"
5,,2016-11-24,,,"I thought product of this quality cost over $100.
Fabulous product and a greta price."
5,"San Diego, CA",2016-11-14,Always come back to it...,,"I have been using this cream on and off for years. Whenever I've strayed and feel lost in the skincare world, Kiehl's welcomes me back with open arms. The ultra cleanser followed by ultra cream. keep it simple and I find my skin allows balances itself out. I prefer the feeling of a cream rather than a gel- use the right amount and you'll be set."
4,,2016-11-03,For those with dry skin,,I learned I had dry skin and was seeking a moisturizer that would provide the moisture my skin needed. This product did the trick. Works well under make up and isn't greasy.
2,,2016-10-25,Very thin/lightweight texture.,too light for dry skin,"I bought this cream and I am upset that a Kiehl's product couldn't match my expectation. I have dry skin but the store rep tested my skin and suggested that I have Normal skin which I don't agree to. However, in that moment - I went with the flow and agreed to her recommendation and bought this cream. As I applied a drop of the cream - it got a little oily on my face and didn't absorb the way I thought it would.It took a while to absorb and all that while my face was shiny which I didn't like. I personally like using something that is a little dense and matte to scoop out from the jar. I am not sure it made my skin look balanced. It looked dull in fact. I am a little disappointed with this product considering that I am a loyal Kiehl's fan since years. I started to use Kiehl's back in India 4 years back and have continued to do so."
5,"Salt Lake City, Utah",2016-10-24,The gateway drug to my kiehl's addiction,heavy when used in excessive amount,"As a recovering Sephora die-hard - one who has tried tens of the industry leaders' ""most hydrating"" moisturizers - I feel confident in my claim that this is the best I've tried, from Clinique to Givenchy, Perricone MD to Shiseido."
5,"Silver Spring, MD",2016-10-10,Great Product,,I have very sensitive skin and allergies (even allergic to mineral makeup)...Keihl's is perfect for me. Light weight and fragrance free; keeps my skin soft and mosturized all year long.
5,"Cherry Hill, NJ",2016-09-30,Great moisturizer for combination skin,,"I have tried the K-beauty trend for about a year, and was unable to find any product that really worked for my skin. My forehead and lower cheek area is very oily, while my upper cheeks, chin, and nose are super dry. This cream is excellent to use after washing with the Rare Earth cleanser."
5,"Bordeaux, France",2016-09-29,"Most Moisturising, Non-Greasy Formula Ever",bit too heavy for summer,I received this product in a pack of Keilhs skincare and fell in love. You only need a little to go a long way and it absorbs to leave no greasy feeling at all on your skin.
5,,2016-09-07,Effective,,"This is a very effective moisturizer. I like the texture of this cream and it is perfect for any season. When I use this in hot weather, it doesn't make me greasy and ""melt"" off my face like cheaper face washes. This product really works well in the winter and dry atmospheres. In the cold winter time, this stuff really protects my face from becoming dry and peeling. It doesn't over-hydrate or under-hydrate my skin; it's just right."
5,"Roanoke, VA",2016-08-04,Best moisturizer,,I got this as a sample and loved it from the first time I tried it that I bought a bigger jar and there isn't a strong scent. Works great on my dry skin.
5,"The Woodlands, Texas",2016-06-29,Favorite Everyday Kiehls Moisturizer,,"This moisturizer is the best one I have ever used and the best moisturizer I have found at Kiehls (although there are many great ones). I actually got this as a Christmas present, and haven't gone back to my old moisturizer since."
5,,2016-06-04,Great product..,,Will last you a year if you buy the large size. Great on the skin. Not too heavy and has a light feel. I ran out and tried another product and came back.
5,CA,2016-05-27,Awesome!,,"I have combination skin,slightly oily in some parts and normal to dry on the others and I didn't know my skin was dehydrated before I started to use this cream! Although my nose was the oiliest part of my face it was flaky every time I put foundation on it. I used different scrubs,serums and light moisturizers but nothing worked,then I used this product,OMG, not only my nose is not flaky anymore my skin has become so soft and smooth:) Definitely recommend it to all people specially ones with combination-normal-dry skin types."
5,,2016-05-20,Love it!,,"Over the years, I have tried LOTS of skin care products, never been happy with any of them, never really saw any results, and just kept looking for something that would work for me. Well, here it is! I recently switched all my products to Kiehl's and couldn't be happier.
I've been really horrible about taking care of my skin, going to bed with makeup on, smoking and not using the right products.
This moisturizer feels so nice, soft and creamy, you only use a very small amount, something I wasn't used to. Even with high end products, I always had to use so much to feel like they were moisturizing my skin. If you use too much of this moisturizer, you may think it feels a little greasy, just a small amount will do!! My skin's texture is so soft and I have a glow I never had before!! All I can say is, BUY IT!!"
5,,2016-05-16,Ultra lightweight,,"Incredible product, is instantly absorbed into the skin. Feels very lightweight and is extremely nourishing without being too heavy and thick on the skin."
5,"Saratoga Springs, UT",2016-05-11,So Heavenly,,"THIS is the product that made me a Kiehls fan.
When I was a teenager, I would try lots of foundations, moisturizers, etc. And I was struggling with breakouts in my T zone and I got to the point that I was just wanting to take care of my skin! I went to Nordstroms actually to just find a GOOD moisturizer and the lady handed me this. I had never really heard of Kiehls until this. She was telling me how she has to wear all sorts of make up brands on different days (just depends on what they are promoting that day and what booth they are at that day), and it's hard on her face to always try all these different make ups. She said that she uses this to bring her face back to a healthy state after putting it through so much. That was over 10 years ago, and I've NEVER looked back. It was everything and more that I could have hoped for in a moisturizer! Now I have a full Kiehls line up for morning and night and my searching is OVER. I've been a loyalist for YEARS and will continue for the rest of my life. Even with my full line up, I never leave this Ultra Facial Cream out- it gives my face the ultimate in moisture, and my skin just drinks it all in. The top 2 things that age your face are sun and dehydration. With this product, I need not fret. There's a reason it's the Best Seller from Kiehls. With all the AMAZING products that Kiehls has, to take the number one spot, that's saying something right there."
5,"Portland, OR",2016-04-26,Best Cream on the Market,,There is a reason this is one of the top creams that Kiehl's has to offer. It's simply superb.
4,NY,2016-04-20,The product is good but ...,,"I can't really stand the smell of the product, it smells like plastic or something like that. Even though it is nice, I found myself using fewer times because of the smell it has."
5,,2016-04-20,Only face cream I will ever use again!!,,Perfect ever day face cream. Not oily and hydrates skin. I'm prone to break outs and with this product I have stopped having regular breakouts!
5,"Olympia, WA",2016-04-15,"Love, love, love this!",,"I bought this moisturizer in a kit with the facial cleanser and toner, and I love this product. It is super lightweight (a little goes a long way) and it doesn't make me break out (I have dry skin). I can wash my face, put on this, and after less than five minutes do my makeup routine. I have had mine for around 6 months and I'm not even half way through, and I use it 1-2 times daily. This is a must have product!"
5,,2016-04-08,Always My Most Loved Moisturiser,,"It feels incredible on my skin, and works like a miracle. Even if it's so humid and hot in the summer, I still love to use it, at night in particular. It doesn't get my face greasy but very moisturised. I haven't experienced break-outs ever since using it, and it's already been 6 years. I've purchased almost 8 jars so far, and still can see myself continuing re-purchasing it. It might cost more than other moisturisers on the market but it's totally worth the money, and you'll be surprised what it brings to you. At first I thought it was going to get the oil all over my face because I'm combination and never used cream but gel, but it totally surprised me the morning after when I saw my face glowing like never before. And until today I'm not done loving it yet."
5,"The Woodlands, TX",2016-03-31,Where has this been all my life????,,"Stumbled upon this cream while shopping with my boyfriend. He said they made good products, so thought I would give it a shot. I have had dry spots on my face for years and years...tried so many things. I noticed a difference the first day, but after 3-4 days all dry spots were gone.
I love putting it on every morning. It feels great, light, cool. Yes it costs more than many you find in other stores, but I promise it is the best you will ever purchase. I'm a teacher so money is not burning a hole in my pocket, but I will gladly pay whatever this costs. It has worked so good for me. Hope you have good results, too."
1,"Boston, MA",2016-03-29,Terrible for Oily Skin,,"Even though I have oily skin, I do not always use products that are specifically for oily skin, and so I decided to give this product a try."
5,"Boston, MA",2016-03-03,My holy grail product,,"I'd tried many moisturizers before I tried this stuff, but I'll never look back. This is truly the perfect moisturizer - gentle, smoothing, absorbs quickly, and completely non-sticky and non-greasy. Believe the hype - there's nothing like it!"
5,,2016-03-02,Worth It,,"I recently purchased this product and have been very pleased with the results. My skin tends to be very dry in the winter, plus I am on a retinol acne medicine--so it's been a struggle to find a quality moisturizer that keeps my skin looking hydrated all day."
5,AZ,2016-02-28,Ultra Facial Cream - New Basic,none,"This product makes my face as soft as a babies bottom. After two uses, I saw a significant difference. This has become my go-to basics."
4,"Madison, Wi",2016-01-31,Love it! But...,,Just discovered this moisturizer last year and have been using it everyday since. This product does everything that's stated on the jar. I will definitely repurchase this moisturizer when I'm out. But I really wish it comes in a tube or bottle because I'm just not a fan of open jars.
2,NJ,2016-01-22,It's okay at best,,"After reading these rave reviews I decided to pull the string on purchasing this moisturizer. I was reluctant at first because I was never the type of person to invest that much more for skin products. I was excited at first to receive the product and try at it on. My first impression was that it was great. It seemed to effectively moisturize my skin while having a light consistency. I felt it also smoothed my skin out a little bit. However, after months of using it, I've grown to dislike the product. It makes my skin excessively oily - even more so than it does naturally. Lately I've been using a L'OREAL moisturizer that my sister gave me. It gets the job done just as effectively without making my skin oily. It's nothing fancy and it makes me really question on what I had purchased. At this point, I am only using the Kiehl's moisturizer to get rid of it. I am not sure if I'll make another purchase."
5,,2016-01-22,Saved My Skin!,,"Over the years I've tried 50+ different products trying to treat my dry/flaky skin. Nothing worked, that is, until I found this Ultra Facial Cream. I'd been on the fence for over two years about trying this product. I'm a poor college student and wasn't sure shelling out 50 dollars for a tiny jar of facial cream would be worth it. It was. I've had it since July '15 and am just now getting to the bottom of the jar. I recommend this to anyone who struggles with dry skin. This cream moisturizes all day for me and keeps my skin looking healthy and fresh!"
5,Texas,2016-01-13,BEST MOISTURIZER!,,This moisturizer is everything. I've been using it for about a month and it is drier than ever in Texas during the winter. I usually apply a basic moisturizer at night and feel fine but then the next day my face is cracked and dry again. Not with the ultra facial cream. My face feels just as moisturized the next day and feels so hydrated. I will never use anything else!
5,"Dallas, TX",2015-12-28,Skincare Staple,,"If you don't own this product, stop what you're doing and go buy it! This is the BEST facial cream I have ever owned. It is so gentle on my sensitive skin and is part of my daily skin regimen. The texture is thin enough without being runny, and has never clogged or irritated my skin. I use this daily prior to applying my makeup and even on days when the makeup stays in the bag!"
5,"Chicago, il",2015-12-27,Can't live with out this,,"I've been using this for years, I love this lotion."
5,,2015-12-11,Awesome product!,,"My entire family is using this product: my mother, two aunts and every one I can think of... Everyone loves it and my father even loves it... (Not sure it's a good thing or not...) With such a great cream, the price is extremely reasonable too! I would strongly recommend this product to any ONE!"
5,"Los Angeles, CA",2015-12-05,"Versatile, oil-free, quick absorbing moisturizer",,"I'm a guy and wanted something I can just put on and forget. I also wanted the product to be quick absorbing. I hate products that leaves a greasy film after a few hours. Before using this product I was using another drugstore brand, its works well but runs out very quickly thus it was very expensive to buy."
5,,2015-12-03,Love it!,,I have been using this cream for 3 years and recommended to my families. This is easy to take in and even good for oily skin!
5,"Chicago, IL",2015-11-12,Woooonderful,,"This cream just feels awesome. Great texture, not too thick. A little bit (as with all Kiehls products) go a LONG way. The big jar lasts me what feels like forever! For a while there I was out of this stuff and resorted to things readily available in the drug store and I will not make that mistake again!"
5,Juneau AK,2015-10-17,Great night cream for my skin,,"I have slightly oily skin, so when I bought this with the intent to be my day cream, I quickly switched it to my night cream instead. The texture is slightly oily and goopy to me, but its a great cream. When I wake up my skin feels silky soft and looks radiant. I use in conjunction with this: ultra facial cleanser, oil free toner, midnight recovery oil with eye cream and this cream is last. Being in my late 20's this cream delivers what I need it to for my skin age concerns."
5,,2015-10-03,Amazing,,"This moisturizer has done amazing things for my skin. It's brighter, softer and more hydrated everyday. I have the small jar and use it everyday. Still hasn't even made a dent in it. Highly recommend this product."
5,"Los Angeles, CA",2015-09-19,Instantly rejuvenates dehydrated skin!,wish it came in bottle form with pump,"As I got older, I noticed my skin was losing it's dewy glowing quality (I'm 28) and started to feel more and more dehydrated. A few years ago, I would never use any moisturizer with the word ""cream"" in it because I knew my face would be an instant oilfield and break out like crazy. However, I am so happy I finally decided to try this product out now. It works wonders! I started using it at nighttime only and when I wake up in the morning, my skin looks amazing! It looks rejuvenated, hydrated, and healthy! It strikes a perfect balance between oil and water. Wish I tried this out sooner!"
5,,2015-08-03,Best moisturizer for sensitive skin!,,"I have terribly sensitive, reactive, dry skin and have struggled to find a moisturizer that works well. This is the best! It moisturizes without making my skin oily, comforts, doesn't burn (a major problem for me) and just plain works. My go to all year long!"
5,NJ,2015-08-02,Love it but....,,Love this product! I love the texture and the way it feels on my skin but it has parabens and I've been trying to stay away from products that contain them :( please make this without parabens!!!!
1,Florida,2015-07-10,No Effect,,"I had an very high expectation for this product, however it disappointed me. I have very dry skin. This product made no difference on my skin. It defiantly does not worth the money."
3,"Chicago, IL",2015-06-25,Just wish it had SPF,no spf,"I have been using this moisturizer for several years now on and off, always looking for a different one but always coming back to this. I love this moisturizer, but just wish it had SPF in it. I always find myself looking for a comparable moisturizer that contains SPF, but they're just never as good. This moisturizer is light, non-greasy, and lasts all day. Even my boyfriend, who despises all things skincare, leaves trails of having used this moisturizer :)"
5,CT,2015-05-04,Best Facial Cream,,"My skin was dry and flaky, I was always annoyed about it. I tried many products, expensive and cheap ones, non of them worked as good as this product. My skin now is soft, smooth and bright. It seems this product makes my pore smaller too. Get this product, you won't regret it. I LOVE IT!"
5,"Brooklyn, NY",2015-05-02,Love this stuff,,"This is like a jar of water for your skin. I have combination skin, so it's hard to find a moisturizer that isn't too heavy, but still quenches my thirsty patches. This stuff is amazing. It is both lightweight in feel and a powerhouse in the moisture department. I am on my third jar. I can't imagine my beauty routine without this product in it. Everyone should have a jar in their medicine cabinet!"
5,,2015-04-24,Simply the Best,,I received this as a gift after undergoing chemo and radiation.

5,"Nashville, TN",2015-01-21,Holy Grail Product!,,"I've searched for a good moisturizer for years, and am soo happy I found this cream! It is by far the best moisturizer I've ever used!

I have combination/dry skin, and I'm so happy to find a moisturizer that delivers without breaking me out! Thank you Kieh's!"
5,"San Francisco, CA",2015-01-03,SUPER Ultra Facial Cream!,,"I normally use the Ultra Facial Moisturizer for all skin types.. but my skin gets a little dry during the harsh winter months. I received a few samples of this upon making a purchase at my local Kiehl's and immediately used it that night. The next day, I felt such a difference with my skin! I had a dry patch on my face and it softened and returned to normal so quickly."
5,,2015-01-02,Great product,,I have very sensitive skin but this product is great. I have been using it almost a year and I love it.
5,"gilbert, AZ",2014-12-19,best moisturizer i've found,,"I have combination oily skin but find that many products dry my skin out too much causing worsening acne and flaking. I struggle to find a moisturizer that doesn't clog my pores or dry my skin out. this is one of the first moisturizers I've found that feels smooth and hydrating but doesn't break me out or make me shiny all day. I used the dermalogica moisturizer for sometime with some luck, but I always had little white bumps and clogged pores...this is the clearest my skin has ever been. I'm glad I found a good moisturizer because i'm getting to that age where I want to hydrate and prevent wrinkles but also not look like an acne ridden 16 year old. I use this with the clearly corrective cleanser and oil free toner. I'm a kiehls fan now!"
5,"Sacramento, ca",2014-12-14,This product made me a kiehls convert,plain packaging,"I got this as a sample and i loved the effect so much that I bought a full size jar of it, along with holiday gift sets to try other kiehls products.

3,,2014-09-04,Ugly surprise,contains parabens and i won't use it anymore,"I've been using this product for years and love it. I was shocked when I looked at the ingredients taped to the bottom of the jar for the first time today...it contains parabens. A serious buzzkill for my image of Kiehl's as a 'healthy' brand. So, all excellent, except that if it has parabens, it's value to me is zero. Please consider reformulating."
4,N. Texas,2014-08-28,Light weight and comfortable,,"This product is great for daily moisturizing however I prefer the Rosa Arctica Regenerating Cream for tons of moisture, esp. at night. This one is fine for daily use."
5,"Cleveland, OH",2014-05-29,"Effective, Great value",,"I've used several different facial moisturizers, but this is by far my favorite. It's light, non-greasy, absorbs quickly, and keeps my face hydrated all day. A little goes a long way, so it's an excellent value.

Been on and out and using other products but still finds this to be the best moisturizer for my combination/dry. I've also tried the ""intense hydration"" version but this seems to work best for me.

To my surprise this moisturizer is a refreshing change from your average moisturizing cream. It has no fragrance, gives my skin a wonderfully natural glow and last all day. I would recommend this product for all types of skin. I have normal skin but have family members who have dry to oily skin and they also use this product."

3,"Minneapolis, MN",2014-05-22,Good Basic Moisturizer... But Not For Me,just not for me,I really thought I'd like this moisturizer but I was disappointed. It's a great basic but I knew it wasn't the one for me right away. I like that hydrated look some moisturizers give and this one didn't do it for me. I held onto it thinking I would use it someday but after finding a moisturizer I love I knew I wasn't going to use it. Luckily Kiehls has amazing customer service and I was able to exchange it many months after purchasing.
5,"Phoenix, AZ",2014-05-22,LOVE,,Hydrates my combination skin really well. I've used many moisturizers from cheap to very expensive and this is the best out there. I've even stopped using this for a while to try some others brands and always keep coming back to the ultra facial cream. Don't hesitate--worth the price!!
5,California,2014-05-22,Basic Moisturizing Must-have!,,"This is the best face cream I've used so far, it's super hydrating yet not greasy, it's pure moisture that's inside! After about 10 minutes, it's completely absorbed and doesn't even feel like greasy on the touch. Only real quality product stays locked in your skin, not floating on the surface (when you can feel it by touching it.) This is guilt free! No harsh chemicals, no fragrance, no dyes, no mistake. Highly recommended. The price is also reasonable for such a great product."

5,colorado,2014-05-21,Best Purchase Ever,,"I like this product! Really smooth feeling with a pleasurable scent. My friend recommended this product to me because I used to have dry skins.

5,,2014-05-21,Amazing Product!! <3,,This is the best daily moisturizer I have used!!! I have sensitive skin & have tired hundreds of products specifically for that and none of them have worked as well as Kiehl's daily moisturizer. Since I was so impressed with this I have started trying new products from Kiehl's and have been extremely happy with all of them. My advice to you if you have not tried any of their products you should definitely start!! Also my experience in their stores and with their customer service has been nothing but completely satisfactory!
5,,2014-05-21,Best Facial Cream Ever,,"Kiehls is always my top choice for skin care, i always recommends to my sisters and friends. Ultra Facial Cream gives you a moisturize skin and absorb quickly. its not stick at all like other products."

Since then, it has kept my face well hydrated, despite the midwest seasonal shifts. Perfect for after the pool, or during a polar vortex. Your face is hydrated, but not oily, or greasy."

5,,2014-05-20,Really great face moisturizer,,The product is really light and works well on my sensitive skin. My skin is usually pretty dry especially in the winter and is sensitive towards some face products. This product doesn't give me the redness and itchiness that some products produce. The cream is also really effective despite its light texture and I've had no problems with dry skin since using this.
5,"New York, NY",2014-05-20,Recommended Moisturizer,,"I have very sensitive skin so I choose my moisturizers very carefully. I've been using this moisturizer for approximately 2 years now and it works just as it says it does. I don't normally put on make-up, just basic everyday moisturizing and this works for night time too if you are not using any other night creams. The cream isnt oily, so when you put it on, it wont feel overwhelmingly oily on your face. Very refreshing."
5,,2014-05-20,Wonderful Product,,"My face has always been dry but ever since I used this product, my face became moist throughout the day. The cream also made my skin smooth. I would truly recommend this product"
5,,2014-05-20,High Value Moisturizer,,Good moisturizing performance without heavy greasy feeling. Feel comfortable to use day and night. Mild and graceful smell.
5,North Carolina,2014-05-20,Best Basic Moisturizer Ever,,"Delivers excellent moisture, absorbs quickly, non-greasy.

Highly recommended!"
5,,2014-05-20,Best Moisturizer ever,,"In winter, my face skin is very dry and I tried many other products, and it didn't work. My friend recommends this product to me, and after 2 days, I felt my skin is becoming better. I love this product, especially using it in fall and winter"

5,"Seattle, WA",2014-05-20,Best Face Lotion Ever,,I have been using the Ultra Facial Cream for about 7 years. Regular use results in an amazing close shave. (No nicks nor cuts and smooth chops). I always apply before bed and it absorbs quickly and is NOT greasy.
5,,2014-05-20,Life saver,,I had used Kiehls awhile back and stopped for some reason. This winter my skin was unrecoverabley dry. I received an email promotion from Kiehls and decided to take advantage. This moisturizer is amazing! It is soothing and refreshing. The texture and smell are a little strange at first but the effects are perfection.
5,,2014-05-20,This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used.,,"This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used. Why would I say that? I bought five bottles of this product one time both in local store and online!!! This is really amazing. I have be using Kiehl's products for a long time and I should say many of this product is really worth to try and keep using it. I have very sensitive skin, using Kielh's products, my skin never appear redness or break outs. Also, I see many stars also use this product as daily necessary skin cares!! That's really cool!!!"
5,,2014-05-20,Excellent for dry skin,,"I rarely purchase the same skin products second time, and I rarely ran out of skin products. This facial cream is awesome on my dry dry skin when it is winter. I love it is fragrance free, and it blends very well on my skin. If you really want something that is bad about this product, maybe it is because its texture is not creamy enough to me. But overall, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this skin product."
4,,2014-05-20,Excellent product,,This is a product that I will recommend to friends. It really helps to moisturize my skin but it doesn't work well when the weather is warm because my skin is combination oily.
5,"Ontario, Canada",2014-05-20,Ultra Facial Cream,,"This is what I live for! Best facial moisturizer ever. I always have a travel size jar in my bag too. Great texture, never greasy, always moist. I dab some under my eyes or even on lips when I don't have anything else to use. Two thumbs up!!"
5,,2014-05-20,Feels great,,"I have very sensitive skin and used to get dry or red easily. After using this moisturizer, I have very few problems.

5,"New York, NY, USA",2014-05-20,Moisture that lasts and isn't greasy,,"My husband won't use moisturizer that is greasy, but he will use Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream."
5,CA,2014-05-20,Must-have for Winter,,"The cream is really moisturizing and healing. For autumn and winter, it is my must-have to calm down my skin and provide sufficient moisture. Highly recommended to anyone who looks for a simple but effective moisturizer."
5,"PALO ALTO,CA",2014-05-20,best moisturizer ever,,"I bought this because my friends can't stop telling me how great it is, and I tried, it's amazing! I have already recommended it to my other friends :)"
5,"Boston, MA",2014-05-20,A must-have moisturizer,,"This moisturizer is absolutely amazing at hydrating the skin. Living in the north, my skin feels constantly dehydrated even in the summer. This moisturizer keeps my skin hydrated and dewy throughout the day. It is also good value for money and I always end up coming back to this moisturizer as it is simple and effective."
4,,2014-05-20,sensitive skin will love it,,"My skin is very dry and I tried many moisturizers (most of them are popular and expensive), but few of them work and even feel pain after using it.
My friend deeply recommended me use Kiehl's Ultra facial cream.
At beginning, I hesitated, but I turned to love it after using it.
When putting this on my face, I never feel pain and irritation which is totally different from other brands.
Once you use it, you will love it and keep using it."
5,,2014-05-20,Love this product,,"I've looked for decades for a moisturizing product that wouldnt break my face out.
Evidently I have sensitive skin, but this product is finally giving me a moisturizer that i can use daily! Thanks Kiehl's!!!"

5,"Reno, NV, USA",2014-05-20,Great cream,,This cream works very well. I have been using it for two years.
5,N. California,2014-05-20,Ultra Facial Cream for oily skin,,I've been a faithful oil-free Ultra Facial Cream user until I used a sample of the regular Ultra Facial Cream. Game Changer! I started with it overnight and it left my skin smooth and supple. No Breakouts!!! I couldn't believe it! I finished the sample and couldn't believe how youthful and quenched my face looked. I ordered the biggest size available. I plan to use as my day and night cream. This is Big move for me. I have been plagued with acne since my teens and now in my mid-30's. But now I can have clear and healthy skin!
4,"Columbus, OH",2014-05-20,Perfect for winter,,I have used this product for over 2 years and I love it. It works really well in winter when the air is dry and when you feel like your skin begins to break apart. This product gives a full moisture overnight and even whole day.
5,,2014-05-20,Best moisturizing cream ever,,By far the best facial cream I've ever used.... I have really dry skin and my face would dry out and get sensitive by mid day so I've always had to put on extra lotion on my face to keep it hydrated but all the extra lotion would make my face look oily.. Not with this product though. I barely use any in the morning and it keeps my skin feeling and looking hydrated til the end of the night!
5,,2014-05-20,Great!!,,Such a great product!! Always come back to Kiehls
5,"Raleigh, NC",2014-05-20,Great Post-Shave Moisturizer,,"In lieu of an aftershave product, I simply us the Ultra Facial Cream after my morning shower and shave. It soothes my skin, and helps lock in the moisture."
5,"Hilton Head Island, SC",2014-05-20,The only moisturizer I trust on my face,a tad pricey,"I've been using the Ultra Facial Cream for so many years that I lost count of the total. I have very sensitive skin and after tons of trial error with other products breaking me out - I found that this one does not. It leaves my face moisturized, but NOT oily. While the product is called CREAM, it is not heavy at all. My skin cannot handle heavy anything. I have trusted Kiehl's for my facial needs and will continue to do so. No one ever guesses my age because my facial skin looks young and radiant - thanks to Kiehl's Ultra Facial Crème. Highly recommend"
5,"Philadelphia, PA",2014-05-20,Great for weather stressed skin,,"I normally don't use skin products which are this rich, but the Ultra Facial Cream is amazing. Even though I am in my 60's, my skin is not really dry. But in the winter when I spend time outdoors, this comes to the rescue. When I have been out in the cold and wind I use this and my skin is no longer stressed and red looking. The cream is not heavy but it is rich and it really does the trick."
5,"Ann Arbor, MI",2014-05-20,Amazing product,,I love this lotion. It kept my skin moisturized all through the dry Michigan winter! I don't know what I would do without it!!
5,Michigan,2014-05-20,Great Facial Cream,,I use this facial cream every day. It keeps my face hydrated without causing break outs.
5,"Orlando, Fl",2014-05-20,Great light-weight moisturizer,,"Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream is a great light-weight moisturizer. I've been using is for the last 10 years or so and haven't looked back. It quickly absorbs into the skin, lasts all day, and is easy to add to your morning routine."
5,Michigan,2014-05-20,Ultra Facial Cream,,"By far, the best feeling Facial Cream I have ever purchased."
5,,2014-05-20,my go to moisturizer,,"I was on the search for the perfect face lotion for a while, and I'll never buy another. My skin is dry in the winter, oily-ish in summer, so I hit all the bases. This cream goes on very light and absorbs immediately, so no feeling of anything on your face. It is completely odorless as well, which is really hard to come by in lotions. I recommend it fully!"
5,"Niles, IL",2014-05-20,Best Facial Cream Ever,,"Love, Love this cream. I have sensitive skin and was looking for a cream that is light but effective. I have finally found one and Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream is it. I use it every morning and night and have seen a difference on how smooth my face feels. Usually I would have dry area, but not since using this cream. Thank you.!"
5,"Seattle, WA",2014-05-20,Excellent choice,,"this is the best product for your hydration creme out of all, even price wise as well. I used to use Bobbi brown and Estee Lauder products but I can't compare to Kiel's because it is totally worth it to switch over. I also recommend to my mom she is a little over 50 and of course she wants to focus on lines and sun damage, so this is not good choice but she loves the texture and very light scene. So if you are looking for regular everyday hydration creme, this is the perfect one."
5,"New York, NY",2014-05-20,Just so good!,,I have using this for over a year now and oh my I'm totally in love with this product! It's natural and very gentle. I was actually surprised that it also work during the summer for my skin. Totally recommend this to anyone!
5,"Chicago, IL",2014-05-19,best in its pricepoint,,"i'm not rich but i am obsessed with my skin. for a little more than drugstore moisturizers i get something comparable to products twice its price. it soaks nicely, doesn't smell which is very important to me. always kind of looking around (have i mentioned i'm obsessed w/ skin care?) and just can't be beat."
1,California,2014-05-13,Very sticky and thick,thick,I wanted to like this moisturizer but....it left my skin feeling sticky and oily and it never appeared to soak into my skin no matter how little i used or how long i waited. Very disappointed.
5,Lyman Wyoming,2014-04-25,Amazing!!,,"I love this product my skin is so much improved. I look 20 years younger !!!!
I am 53. People say I look 34. I feel 34. Amazing"
2,New Jersey Suburbs,2014-04-16,This just didn't work for me,no hydration,"I read the reviews before I purchased this product, but, unfortunately, it just didn't work for me. I bought this cream for additional hydration during the winter but my skin did not feel hydrated even when I used a lot of cream. It seems to have more of a gel-like consistency -- perhaps it's the glycerin. And when I rubbed my forehead, for example, my skin seemed to exfoliate. This is the first Kiehl's product that I do not like."
5,Los Angeles Area,2014-03-27,The most moisture for you money$$$!,,"I like to use samples when I go on vacation, easier to pack. Somehow I had previously missed the ""24hour"" note on the label and applied this before bed. It's consistency was lighter than I expected for a cream, so I almost used too much. In the morning I expected to find an oil slick on my forehead, but instead my skin looked great. I ended up using it the rest of the weekend and never got a case of the shiny's like I was expecting. This stuff is a real value."
5,"Los Angeles, CA",2014-03-27,Great moisturizer!,none,"I started using this moisturizer during our ""dry season"" when no other moisturizer was working. It made my face feel moisturized without feeling greasy or heavy. It goes on smoothly and works well with make-up. I highly recommend this moisturizer for combination or oily skin."
5,"Richmond, VA",2014-03-17,My Only Permanent Product,pricey,"I have slaved over Sephora so many times trying to find a moisturizer that is right for my skin. I have an olive skin tone with mixed patches of oily/dry. I also suspect that I have sensitive skin because other high end products like Murad made my pores burn and my skin would reject it, holding no moisture. I received the Ultra Facial Cream as a sample and I will NEVER go back! This product is heavenly. I honestly have no idea how they could develop something so soothing, light, and non-greasy. It's a little pricey, but I feel like it's worth every penny. It's been the only product that has held up in my beauty regiment every single day aside from my weekly application of coconut oil. It keeps my face looking dewey (but not greasy at all) and fresh all day. P-E-R-F-E-C-T."
5,"Seattle, Washington",2014-03-15,CLOUD NINE,,The best moisturizer that I have ever had! I have been using this for the past 2 years. I have very dry skin on Winter. Does not make my face oily instead of radiant looking. I usually use this before using any pressed powder foundation on my face.
5,Colorado,2014-03-11,Best moisturizer I ever used,,I have used many moisturizers over the years and this is by far the best. I have very dry skin and this moisturizer keeps my skin hydrated all day and my skin looks much healthier.
5,,2014-03-08,one of the best skin product,,It applies gently to my sensitive skin and also has a great scent!
4,"Minneapolis,MN",2014-02-19,must have!,Greasy,I bought this product last winter. I live in extremely cold minnesota and this product rocks! My skin is soft after apply it. i give it 4 star cuz it is a little bit greasy.
5,North Carolina,2014-01-26,A Winter Skincare Staple,,"I purchased this cream over a month ago, and I've used it every day since. It is one of the best moisturizers I've ever used, and it has saved my dry winter skin. The cream is quickly absorbed and doesn't leave a sticky or greasy residue like a lot of other moisturizers I've tried. It keeps my skin balanced throughout the day. I will continue to use this product daily and definitely plan to repurchase when I run out."
5,"Grinnell, IA",2013-12-27,face saver,too oily for summer,"i live in a very dry place, especially in winter. This product is too oily for summer but saved my face in winter. i am buying my second ultra facial cream and would definitely recommend this to my friends(some of them already using this.)"
5,"Mountain View, CA",2013-12-27,Facial Cream Not Greasy,,"I love this cream! I use it before I sleep and after I get out of bed. Other creams I used creates dryness and pimples on my skin. I remember running out of this cream, so I used Olay, but it was greasy and the smell was too much for me. It was heavily scented. Then I used Jergens, but it doesn't hydrate my face all day. And I was just happy when my Ultra Facial Cream came in the mail because I was freaking out because of the break outs I was having. I love how neutral the product is and the goodness it does to my skin. It's not too expensive compare to Clinque and too cheap compare to Olay products. It does the work and and I'd recommend to friends and families."
5,,2013-12-23,The reviews are true!,,"This is a great, smooth, basic face lotion that has the added plus of being great for acne prone skin. One thing to be aware of is it leaves a slight sheen, but you can either enjoy being dewey, or put a light powder on. Made my skin healthier for sure!"
5,"Harleysville, PA",2013-12-16,Lovely Moisturizer,,"I have super dry, sensitive skin and I love this product. It hydrates my skin properly and is not greasy nor heavy textured. It's a simple product I would say suitable for many skin types, and i will continue to use for the future."
1,"plano,tx",2013-12-16,contains methylparaben and proylparaben,contains paraben,I have not used this product long enough and won't know if I will. I order it online and find out it contains Paraben!!! This is not listed in the website!
5,"Dallas, TX",2013-11-30,Perfect moisturizer,a little expensive,"I have historically struggled to find a moisturizer to suit my thin, dry, sensitive, and acne-prone skin. I've tried so many that were thick, suffocating, gave me zits, were irritating and over-fragranced, or just totally ineffective against dry skin. Ultra Facial Cream is perfect in every way. I have been using it morning and night for 2 years (just ordered my 4th jar) and I have never been happier with a moisturizer. It has a wonderful texture that is perfectly balanced- spreadable but not runny, luxurious but not too thick. Works great in every season-- I just use less in the summer. I love putting it on, and my skin instantly plumps up. It just makes my skin look/feel healthy! It has no scent and is very soothing when my skin gets itchy in the winter. Will caution though; don't apply too much at one time or it will sit on top of your skin! I use a pea sized blob for my whole face and neck."
5,"Staten Island, NY",2013-11-21,Glides on smoothly and magically softens and smooths with NO RESIDUE!!!,,"This product is simply amazing. I just got through the sample jar i received when i purchased other products i LOVE from Kiehl's. The cream has a heavenly refreshing subtle scent and glides on effortlessly leaving no residue...therefore NO SHINE like other products/ face lotions.
Just superb and the price is unheard of with similar products in the $100plus range. Great value, great product. Another KIEHL'S winner!"
5,,2013-10-31,I love it.,,My skin is not dry anymore.
5,Covington KY,2013-10-21,Zena,,I am 65 and practically wrinkle free. I have been using this for at least 5 years and would not consider another product. It's creamy rich but not greasy. I love how it makes my skin feel soft while it minimizes and softens lines in my face and neck. All the younger women in my office want to know what I use and I tell them. Some have followed up and they love it too!
4,,2013-10-19,Great product!,,"After trying out different moisturizers which would work in some weather and not so in others and having a cabinet full of stuff, I tried this and have been very pleased! It works great as a moisturizer or even under make up. It has also become my night cream of choice now and greatly helping me to reduce the number of products I have and don't use!"
5,South Carolina,2013-10-14,Wish I found it sooner!,nothing,I was using Creme De La Mer for years and spending $150 for a 1 oz jar. Stumbled upon this website and gave it a try. Was worried about how light this lotion felt in comparison but a little bit goes a long way and made my face feel so much healthier and hydrated in just a couple days. And bonus when I put it on before my powder foundation it gives me a beautiful glow. Best lotion I've found in years and the price is amazing! Can't wait to try more products!
5,Orange County California,2013-10-07,Best Daytime Moisturizer Ever!,,"I have tried so many daytime moisturizers including some very expensive store brands, and this is my all time favorite!

5,Alabama,2013-10-06,Best all-time moisturizer,i wish it had spf protection,"I have used this moisturizer for years. It always makes my skin feel good and

5,,2013-10-06,My favorite Moisturizer!,,"I have very sensitive skin.
I suffered from Atopy when I was a kid, and because of it my skin is very sensitive and also very dry.
So I tried multiple moisturizers to find the moisturizer that does not give me any skin troubles or redness on the face.
And Ultra Facial Cream is the one that I've found.
very moisture (however, due to extreme dryness of my skin, I have to apply it often) and smooth formula!"
5,"Hubbard, OH",2013-10-06,Procats,,"I love this moisturizer and use no others. It hydrates your skin and is like giving your face a big glass of water to drink in. I love it so much, I am on automatic shipping. I highly recommend this lotion if you have drier skin. Love it."
5,"Leesburg, Va",2013-10-06,Ultra Facial Cream,,All in one Cream and LOVE it! I was looking for a face cream to fight off the daily harsh effects of the environment! This cream is light and refreshing. I wear it all day and it last. Non-greasy and lightweight. Thank you.

4,,2013-10-04,"Good, but maybe not for me",,This lotion was pretty good--but I just don't think it was best suited for my skin type. A little stickiness lingered after application... perhaps it could benefit from a lighter texture?
5,"Ann Arbor, MI",2013-10-03,I have nothing bad to say about it...,,"It's simple, non-fuss, scent-free, rich but not greasy moisturizer. I don't really have anything bad to say about it. It does the job and it does it very well."
5,,2013-10-02,Great moisterizer,,I love this product. My trick is to store it in the fridge. It has a nice cooling affect when you apply it. This is especially great during the summer.
5,,2013-10-01,a MUST HAVE,,I generally have sensitive skin and it's hard for me to look for a cream. I have found the cream of all creams!! It's best for the winter time since I have drier skin in the winter time. I recommend this to all my friends that have dry skin in the winter time.
5,LA,2013-10-01,Feel comfortable,,I lived in dry area-- Utah & LA. I have tried several lotions and cream and still feel dry very soon until I found this cream. It works very well without any oily feeling. Absorb very fast too. Good for day and night use.

Matter how dry or oily skin have no problem in severe environment protection also play hurt, that does not exceed the oil and moisture. Ames winter, people with oily skin are dry to the point of itching.

5,"New York, NY",2013-09-06,Love it,,"No lie.. I started seeing a difference in my skin after 24hrs of use. I would definitely recommend this product. I have been searching for the perfect moisturizer, and now I have found it!"
5,,2013-08-25,such a great product,,"I'm not really a fan of buying expensive product but I decided to try this cream. I love it!!! I've seen tremendous results. I usually use it after my shower. Another great thing is that a little goes a long way; it is worth every penny. The silky, smooth texture makes it light. My acne has minimized and my skin is smooth and clear."
5,,2013-07-18,Love it the most,,"I've been using this cream for a very long time. Ever since I got my first purchase from Kiehl's, I decided to be their forever fan. Looking forward to my new stuff bought from them."
3,,2013-07-09,Good,,This cream is really nice if you have dry skin. It is definitely not meant for oily skin as its very greasy. Initially it was good on my skin and then i started noticing blackheads on my face as it was oily on my skin.
5,NY,2013-05-03,Seriously MOISTURIZES!,leaves skin a bit shiny,"With the hot weather approaching, my skin has become more and more dry lately. I used to use an Aveeno moisturizer I really liked it, but I just realized it wasn't cutting it when I'd return to the vanity to put on more after feeling like my skin was still very tight and feeling almost flaky."
5,San Diego,2013-04-08,I keep coming back to this product!,,"I absolutely LOVE this cream. It's thick and perfect for dry skin. When you put a small dot on your face (that's all it takes!), it absorbs so easily and has no greasy after feel. I even got my boyfriend hooked on it, he uses it for dry patches around his nose. It doesn't have a fragrance, and perfect for thirsty skin. My face always feels very tight and uncomfortable after I wash it, but a little bit of the cream refreshes and softens instantly. Perfect for applying before makeup. For those put off by the price, the jar lasts a very long time. I bought the larger size at Christmas, and I still have half a jar left, (I use it twice a day, once in the morning, once in the evening) so I can see it lasting at least 6 months, if not more. I cannot recommend enough!"
5,"Orlando, FL",2013-03-04,Miracle cream for winter!,,"I live in humid Florida and I have combination skin that normally only requires a light gel moisturizer. But after a ski trip that left my skin chapped, dry, cracked, and feeling like sandpaper, I was in search of a more substantial moisturizer for my next ski trip. I popped into the Kiehl's store on a whim and this was recomended to me and I bought it along with the cleanser and toner from the same line. It is a MIRACLE product! It kept my skin perfectly soft and moisturized over 6 days of skiing in single digit temps and high winds. The difference was incredible. It also did not feel overly heavy and absorbed quickly and did not make me break out. You don't need to use any more than any other moisturizer, a litle goes a long way. This will be my go to cream for cold weather and dry climates forever! The Ultra Facial Cleanser is fantastic as well!"
5,California,2013-02-11,Super Moisturizing,not for oily skin.,"I have combination skin with a few dry areas and a more oily T-Zone. I applied it in the morning after using a cleanser and by the end of the day, my dry areas don't show up, but I do feel a bit too oily around my nose and forehead. This is an excellent product for those with normal to dry skin, or during the wintertime. I probably won't continue it because of my own skin type but I would recommend it. I have sensitive skin, and this goes on so smoothly and absorbs quickly."
5,,2013-02-08,Staple Item,,"This is a great basic moisturizer that suits all different skin types. My skin is combination to oily and it definitely balances it out. Even in the harsh winter my skin does not feel dry and you don't feel like you need to use a large amount with every application. The small jar lasts a long time. For use in the morning, make sure you layer SPF 50 over it for sun protection."
5,"Silver Spring, Maryland",2013-02-04,Simple the best moisturizer out there!,,"I'm a college student studying by day and working by night.
When I don't get enough sleep and am constantly stressed, it takes a toll on my skin immediately.
I've tried all the ""good"" moisturizers out there, but even though a little pricey for a poor college student like me, nothing beats Kiehl's ultra facial cream!
When I wake up in the morning, my face is glowing even in the harshest winters. I don't even use a primer before makeup because ultra facial cream does its job so well!
I use this before makeup and pat it lightly so it's fully absorbed, and my skin looks flawless. No flakey skin, foundation goes on smooth, and no oily face syndrome anytime throughout the day!
Now my mom and my brother are sneaking in my room to use a bit of this kiehl goodness before they get caught!
No one uses my ultra facial cream without my permission >:(
I've become a lifetime fan... How can I turn to any other product?
Thank God for Kiehl, love you guys <3"
5,"Los Angeles, CA",2013-02-02,A GIFT FROM THE GODS!,none! (:,"This cream is a life saver. This past winter has been incredibly harsh on my skin. This was the first time that cold weather ever affected my skin to a point where no moisturizers were working. Absolutely nothing was working. So I bought this product after seeing all the good reviews -- AND I AM SO GLAD I DID. Like, I can't even express it. Not only is it good for keeping your skin hydrated in cold/harsh weather, but I have not had a blemish since I started using this cream. NOT ONE. My skin is soft and dewy. Normally my skin is very oily, but this has kept it very balanced. I have extremely sensitive eyelids and this cream soothes and hydrates them. I use it twice a day. This will forever be my daily/nightly moisturizer. I found magic when I found this product; never want to run out of it! Sorry but I'm kind of obsessed with this moisturizer."
5,,2013-01-22,Best,,"I let people know I was looking for a new moisturizer and thus received several gifts of cream at the holidays, including Lancome Absolue Premium and products from Clinique and Origin as well as a tube of something from La Roche Posay. I also received a Kiehl's gift pack featuring the body lotion and scrub which also happened to include a tiny jar of the Ultra Facial Cream. This cream is by far the winner - amazing all around moisture - manages to feel thick and creamy but not greasy."
5,,2013-01-17,Finally Found my Moisturizer!,,"I've searched for years for a moisturizer for the winter. My face gets very dry and nothing I've tried works, Until Ultra Facial Cream. I've used the last 2 nights and can already see and feel a difference. My skin isn't dry or flaky. In 2 nights!"
5,,2013-01-07,"Very Dry Skin, Best Moisturizer I Have Ever Used!!",,"I have extremely dry skin year round, the kind of skin that gets so dry it peels in the winter time, and is dry even in the summer time. I have tried numerous expensive moisturizers over the years, and nothing has ever worked until I tried this. It's amazing!! I pat my face lightly with a little water and use the cream on top to seal in the moisture. With this cream, my skin is always moisturized and supple. I have even gone a day before without using it, because I went out of town and forgot it, and my skin stayed moisturized! This showed me that the cream was truly moisturizing my skin from the inside out, and not just smoothing the skin on top. I live in the cold Pennsylvania weather, so if it can keep my skin smooth and supple here, it can do it anywhere!"
5,"Chicago,IL",2013-01-02,Great product in winter,,"I bought this moisturizer last year. My cheeks is dry and my T-zone is oil, so it's hard for me to find a good moisturizer. When I first used it in winter, I fell in love with it. It hydrated my skin and didn't make it looks oily. And a little goes a long way, you only need a little bit for the whole face and neck. However, I only need it in winter. In summer, I would prefer a oil-free moisturizer instead of this."
5,Indianapolis,2012-12-12,Excellent for those who has extremely dry skin.,none,"During fall and winter, my skin becomes more dry. I've tried using all kinds of creams but none worked. My skin get dry, scaly, and sometimes painful patches. This product helped my skin retain moisture even in the dead of winter! My scaly patches? Gone! I've been using it for 2-3 years now. Small amount goes a long way. I bought one for my mom and now she loves it! She's 68 and i'm 35!"
5,"Raleigh, NC",2012-11-30,Best Face Cream,none!,"This face cream is just amazing. I have very dry, very sensitive skin, and everything clogs my pores and makes me break out. This cream, though, has worked great, and now that it's winter, I'm even more convinced. I use it at night on my eyes, nose and forehead, and then during the day I wear it all over my face under my liquid foundation. The blackheads on my nose have gone away, and I used to have little bumps like little grains of sand on the bridge of my nose, and my skin was so dry. Now that's all gone. I use it in conjunction with the Ultra Face Wash and I haven't had any breakouts since I've started using these two. NOT ONE. Buy these two products immediately for a perfectly balanced face wash regime. You can't beat the price, either. The travel size for the face wash is $9."
4,"Chicago, IL",2012-11-24,Great product - especially for winter months,,"I am a LONG time fan of this moisturizer. It's the best winter moisturizer I've found over the years and it's well worth the price (a little goes a long way). I wish it had more natural ingredients, but, other than that, no complaints."
5,,2012-09-24,Love this cream,,The first time I used this I felt a noticeable difference. My face was smoother and more supple. Nice and light and easy to use. Non-greasy. Good value.
5,"Northampton, MA",2012-09-16,Best Facial Cream Ever,,"I have already used 3 large jars of this cream. I have combination skin, so I do tend to get an oily T-zone, but this cream keeps my skin moisturized and soft. I love it especially during winter when my skin gets really dry. I started using this cream when I had bad acne, but it did not irritate or make my acnes worse. Now, after 3 jars, my skin has one or two pimple, so it explains how mild the cream is. It sometimes stings when my skin is really dry, but that's my skin's problem not the cream's problem. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family. My friend started using this because of me, and she loves it too!"
5,"Round Rock, TX",2012-09-14,Face (Skin) saver,,I was relocated by my company from Asia to US last fall. I landed in US and found the weather is cold and dry.

Thank you Kiehl's!

5,,2012-09-13,This is the to die for cream of the eternity,,"I'm getting up there with age, and pretty much have tried the gambit, and settled for cheap. Well I'm here to tell you, a little bitty sample changed my mind. We were getting our daughter set up with a skin care system and they threw a bunch of examples our way. So I snagged a few, and the ultra facial cream knocked my socks off. Could anything feel so smooth and creamy yet not greasy? It was light as air, yet moisturized my face and my face really started looking younger and not so parched. You only need a little dab, so the sample lasted a long time, and I was loath to see it end. Now I will have to mail order it, as no stores are near our area. And don't you love how I got my daughter hooked at a young age. Thank you for caring for our skin in such a fine and masterly way."
5,"Lausanne, Switzerland",2012-09-13,You can't live without it,prefer it to be in a spray container.,"This is an excellent product! I used to be a loyal customer of japan made product. However, ever since I move to Switzerland (less humid, and dry) I begin to have peeling skin until I found this mini ultra facial cream!

5,,2012-09-13,Moist and fresh,,"Very good moisturizer. It made my skin feel plump, hydrated, and a little dewy. For my skin, it worked particularly well in the winter, when my skin tends to be drier. It feels rich, but it's light with a nice finish."
5,California,2012-09-13,Absolutely wonderful,,"I love this product. It makes my skin feel supple and moisturizes without leaving a greasy film. My skin is very sensitive, but I am able toI use it daily and before bedtime. It is one of my all time favorite products and is very reasonably priced. I have used very expensive products, but can honestly say that this facial cream works just as well, if not better those."
5,California,2012-09-13,Perfect everyday cream,,"This is a perfect cream. Non greasy, rich and no real fragrance.

5,Oklahoma，OK,2012-09-13,the most cost-effective moisturizer,,My skin type is combination and sensitive. So what I need is to keep skin heathy and hydrated. ULTRA FACIAL CREAM performances perfectly on both aspects. Additionally，even though it's small and exquisite，a little can go a long way! But I would to say it is better for me to use it during the dry and cold weather since my t-zone is prone oily in summer. However overall，UFC is the most cost-effecitve moisturizer I have ever used !！！
5,,2012-09-13,I bought it again and again,,"I bought this product again and again, first for my self, then for my sister, we both love it! It is the best facial cream, especially for my sensitive skin."

5,"New York, NY",2012-09-13,Best Ever!,,"This is the best moisturizer ever, especially if you have extra dry sensitive skin like me. Unlike a lot of other moisturizers I've purchased, this one is not oily (at all!) and it just sinks into your skin. It also doesn't have a scent, which I very much appreciate.
My husband even swears by it, who would never spend more than $5 on a moisturizer. In fact, whenever we run out, he's the one that reminds me that we need to get more!"
5,,2012-09-13,Best for Dry Skin,,"Ultra Facial Cream is an absolute must for dry, sensitive skin that needs extra hydration. In the winter, I use this product every morning to keep my skin soft and protected from harsh winds and chilly temperatures. Usually I get chapped easily, but since using this cream I haven't had a problem. It's essentially fragrance-free. I have also found that it's a great base for my make up so I don't end up looking like half of it's gone by the time I leave work."
5,New York,2012-09-13,Love Ultra Facial Cream,,This cream was recommended to me by my sister. Love the texture & the fact that it has no smell. It's light & not greasy. Great for warm weather. Not for the winter if you have dry skin.
5,"Ann Arbor, MI",2012-09-13,This is what angels feel like,,"When I first purchased this creme in Chicago I was feeling wind blown and dried out. I put it on and started back walking through the city. About an hour later when I looked in to a window I saw my reflection and smiled. My skin was hydrated and the wrinkles around my eyes were almost gone. I felt my face later that night after apply the moisturizer again and wanted to kiss myself.

4,,2012-09-12,Great moisturizer without that greasy feeling,,A lot of moisturizers I've tried leave my fave feeling greasy and I get increasingly shiny throughout the day.

5,"San Diego, CA",2012-09-12,Incredible product!,not a thick cream,"Absolutely love this product. I don't need to use day or night cream. Because there is no fragrance, my husband and my kids started using it as well and they loved it. It's moisterizing and you do not need a lot to cover your face like other products. The cream is not thick, but very effective. Highly recommended. I started out with a sample and I had to try more. I have combination skin and it did not make me break out."

4,Oregon,2012-09-11,"For night use only, or very dry skin types",not for oily skin,"I have normal/combination skin (oilier in the t-zone and drier on the cheeks) and this cream made my t-zone VERY oily. That said, it works great as a night cream and would likely also be a great day cream for someone with a dry skin type. For my skin though, it's nighttime use only. It made my skin very smooth and did not seem to cause breakouts."
4,"Phoenix, AZ",2012-09-11,Great for night or day use,,"Highly moisturizing. Perfect basic product to go along with all those serums, primers, sunscreens, and other specialized face treatments. Good for younger skin that does not require fancy antiaging ingredients."

I've been a long time customer of (dare I say) Proactive but haven't gotten the bang for my buck. Their Green Tea Moisturizer doesn't meet the level of hydration that pleases me. I stumbled upon a sample size of the Ultra Facial Cream and have honestly feel in love. This product has changed my skin for the better and has made my makeup look better when applied. I intend to purchase this product for all my friends and family.

4,los angeles,2012-09-07,Light and soft,,"I like to use this during the winter time. My face gets really dry after I cleanse in the shower. Ultra Facial Cream is very light. It doesn't smell, and it goes on very smoothly. It takes just a couple dabs with my finger. a little bit of product goes a long way. it doesn't feel heavy, and it hydrates all night. i wake up a little oily looking, but it is very easy to wash off and it feels clean. very good lightweight coverage."
5,,2012-09-06,My travel companion!,,"I LOVE love this cream! I am a flight attendant who is constantly subjected to dry air in the aircraft and stuffy dry hotel rooms. This cream I actually bought onboard from our duty free cart and now it stays in my bag to protect my skin from drying out. It continually moisturizes for hours, so even if I am going NYC to Tokyo now I don't dry out! It has worked better than many other products I have tried- and I have tried many - my nickname is ""product queen""!"
4,"Albany, NY",2012-09-06,moderate moisturizer,,It's a little bit hard to apply. I usually scoop a bit and heat it with my palm so it's easier to apply. I like the non-scented cream and it's really helpful in winter times.

The ultra facial cream got rid of the dryness but isn't greasy feeling at all, it's very lightweight. I apply it after I get out of the shower and then put on my makeup right after. I didnt even have to switch moisturizers in the summertime and usually my skin gets more oily. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a variety of skin types, and it didn't make me break out."

Because I just moved to America, my dry skin is getting worse:( So my friend and internet sources recommended me to this goody.

This cream is very moisture, seems like pouring water into your skin. It also has a PERFECT WATER & OIL BALANCE!! (A cream with only high water will dry quickly & a cream with only oil will turn your face into a oilfield) But this cream has a balance between water and oil. Water in this cream gives moisture and oil makes a shield which protects skin from dehydration."

4,Florida,2012-09-05,This is a rad moisturizer.,,"I have sensitive skin and my skin tends to break out to everything. This product doesn't make me break out at all. The Ultra Facial Cream does what it says, it leaves my skin feeling nice and not too moisturized. There are many moisturizers that leave my skin oily, which this does not. I think the texture of the cream is pretty thick, but it's not too creamy at the same time. If that makes sense. I can put this on in the morning then by the time I come home, my skin still feel alive. Most of the time, my skin is dull looking ugh! This product helps get rid of that problem. Everyone should try a sample :)"

When I put it on, my skin felt instantly soft. It did not feel heavy or like I had a mask on my face, which I often find the issue to be with other products. I found it to absorb quickly without a greasy effect. I use this product at night over the Midnight Concentrate Serum and by morning my skin looks refreshed and well rested even when I'm not. My skin looks and feels balanced. I use the oil free gel moisturizer for during the day."

I had such dry skin that friends would ask if I had been to the beach lately as my face was completely peeling. I was desperate and tried a sample of this. HOLY HOT PANTS, BATMAN! This cream really does work! I use it at night with a barrage of other products but I was sold from the get-go. Never have to add more in the morning because my skin is completely hydrated.

Plus, it didn't cause me any breakouts or allergies so this is definitely one of my staple products."
5,,2012-08-30,Best Lotion for Skin in the Winter,,"Wintertime in New England is always so horrid and drying. My face always feels cracked, dry , and uncomfortable. I always use the ultra facial cream for times like these. It gives just the right amount of moisture to your skin, it feels like you got a whole new face after you put this on. Like water being put back into your face to hydrate. So soft and smooth and it doesn't feel heavy at all. I've started even using this in summer time when I ran out of my other Kiehl's lotion (the sodium pca one) and this works just as well in summer time too. Everyone should try this at least once and you'll feel the difference."
4,"Pittsburgh, PA",2012-08-30,Great with Ultra Facial Toner,,I started using this cream after I use the Ultra Facial Toner and I love how light the cream is on my face.

5,"New York, NY",2012-08-30,Perfect do-nothing moisturizer,,"Remember the philosophy of do-nothing in Kung Fu Panda? that's what i feel about this product. It does not promote some fancy high-tech formulas, which i abhor. You know you're covered without worrying about waking up with shiny face or mid-day t-zone disaster. Perfect for the price, too. If i have to pick on something, i would say packaging needs a bit work. Scooping out of a jar and slathering it onto my face is not my favorite..."
5,,2012-08-20,found at last!,none,"I borrowed this product in autumn 2011 from a friend in San Francisco. Loved it, bought some when I returned to dry northern New Mexico hoping it would work as well. It was fabulous and I haven't used anything else since.

5,"Boston, MA",2012-07-13,My Favorite Product,need to make a bigger size!,"Both my boyfriend and I use this cream on a daily basis and we both looooove it! I have really dry flaky sensitive skin and can never find a face cream that will provide enough moisture while not making me super shiny at the same time. This cream soaks right in and leaves my face incredibly soft. My boyfriend is super picky, hates scented creams, and worries about fine lines that show up when his skin doesn't get enough hydration. This product is everything he has ever dreamed of and refuses to believe there is anything else he will use on his face for the rest of his life. The only down side? The biggest tub between the two of us is gone in a month and a half. It would be nice if they had a bigger one!"
5,"Boston, MA",2012-07-10,Best Product,none,"I have combination skin as I am of Sicilian/German descent, that goes either oily or dry and flaky depending on the season.

The texture and the smell is very nice (natural smell). But the best thing is it gives you maximum benefit for your dry skin. I really cannot leave with this product. I also reccomended this to my boyfriend (he has a dry skin too) and he loves it. Thank you Kiehl's for creating a very wonderful product."
5,"Chicago, IL",2012-04-23,Love it!,no spf,This cream is amazing! I am prone to acne with super oily skin and I found that I don't need to use multiple products when I started using the Ultra Facial Cream. SPF would be a major plus.

5,New Jersey,2012-02-07,Amazing!,,"I bought the 1.7 fl oz size October 2011, it's February 2012 and it's just finishing. My skin is extremely sensitive and I've tried what seems like everything to keep it moisturized and balance. I am also acne prone but dislike products made to treat it so I exfoliate once or twice a week and just rinse with warm water the rest of the week and top with a moisturizer. This product didn't build up and irritate my skin which is a huge plus. Within about a month of using this facial cream my face felt softer that it ever did and I am still loving it."
5,"Denver, CO",2012-02-06,Good face cream,,"Ultra hydrating, I got this because I recently moved from California to Colorado and boy did the dryness take me by surprise. Everything is DRY, DRY, DRY. read that this was given to adventurers in greenland? Iceland? Wherever; and thought I'd try it. So happy I did! Works perfectly for the winter, keels my face nice and moisturizer, and really that's all I ask. Not sure how it will do in the summer, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Even though I keep hoping its just around the corner, I think that recent blizzard is a huge reminder that winter is still in full force. :-( Good value by the way, big tub is only around 50 bucks, and I've been using it for minimum 3 months and have used like 1/16? It's so hydrating that you don't need to use a whole lot."
4,bx n.y,2012-01-27,perfect balance,,"My situation is a little diffrent. My skin had become really dry because i use retin a at night, clinique moisturizing lotion was to greasy for my skin other moisturizers were the same this is the only moisturizer with the perfect balance for my skin not drying and not oily, it has greatly reduced the drying effect of retin a on my skin. even though i feel no product can take away all the drying effects of retin a This moisturizer comes in really close. It also makes my skin look and feel smooth. I wish kiehls had this same formula with sunscreen."

I got a sample of this cream while I was Christmas shopping and decided what the heck, I'll give it a try... I am SO in love with this product!! It feels ultra light.. not heavy, greasy, or thick...AND it really gets the job done! I've tried lots of different products before but I really love the lightweight texture of this cream. It just feels really clean and light and it really works well. I'll be using this from now on!! Well worth the money!"
5,"Boston, MA",2012-01-13,BEST Moisturizer for dry skin,expensize,"This stuff is fantastic. I've always had very dry skin from New England winters which resulted in flaking skin. I started using this stuff, and my skin stays perfectly moisturized all day, no signs of dryness or flaking. I would suggest getting the bigger size for the price, the 1.7oz is pretty small. Only con is this stuff is expensive, but if youre only using it when you really need it (winter months), one or two jars of this stuf should cover you. Amazing product, well worth the $."

Like everyone says, it's lovely light and ultra moisturizing! And you're skin will thank you for the extra TLC during these harsh seasons. It'll be like a drink of water for your skin. I even dab a little on in the morning to keep my skin from drying during the day when I have to walk around on campus. I'll ask for a sample of the SPF version too when I go to buy my full size (I'm picky about my products since I'm super sensitive to new products!)."

I was very skeptical of the texture because I'm used to denser and heavier creams (a subconscious thing I used to believe in), but this cream really blew me away. It goes on light and absorbs quickly yet it continues to moisturize all-day. My skin feels great and a little really goes a long way so this is a great value."

I found it!"
5,CT,2011-10-02,Ultra Indeed!,,"I picked this moisturizer up to use before bed during the summer. Now that the weather is getting cooler, I am 100% comfortable using this moisturizer during the day. It absorbs so quickly! It doesn't sit on skin like some other moisturizers and you have to fan your face waiting for it to dry. This face cream knows exactly where to go! Into your skin! It is not heavy at all and leaves my skin dewy and refreshed. It almost repairs my skin. When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks like it had a great night sleep, even if I didn't! Highly recommend."

I recommend this to my boyfriend (same age as me), his skin was really dry after he came back from his trip in Europe; he used other brand's products and they did nothing on his face. I gave him my ultra facial cream and asked him to try it out, see if this works for him. After few days, he said this works for his face!

I applied a thick layer of this face cream twice a day and my skin went back to normal in a week! This stuff is awesome for winter, since it really counteracts the drying effects of wind and cold air and relieves that tight skin feeling.

It feels like a protective moisture film on my face. It is not too heavy or oily also - I live in a humid tropical climate region and I think still totally works for me. What else can I say? I LOVE IT!! I can safely say it's by far the best moisturizer I have bought."

When my skin feels dry I can literally feel my skin just drinking it up when I apply. It is super moisturizing but I didn't feel like it was thick on my skin.

5,Yakima WA,2011-01-22,Wow!,unscented :),"I am a 54 year old Latina with medium brown skin. I don't have deep wrinkles and have pretty smooth skin for my age. I live in the Pacific Northwest in a very dry climate and also suffer from Sjogren's Syndrome which is the body's inability to produce enough moisture. I normally use the Abyssine 23 SPF moisturizer which I love but noticed that this past winter, I had crepe-y skin at the spot just under my eye sockets and the tops of my cheek bones. I read the reviews on the Ultra Facial Cream and decided I'd try it. It is not thick and greasy and very light and rich -- had to admit I had doubts as to it's effectiveness. I also use the dry Argan oil on my face before putting on the moisturizer and followed the same routine. The results were not noticed until the end of my long day when I put my hands to my cheeks to feel the skin and noticed that it felt very smooth. I went to the mirror and looked at my trouble areas and that's when I said ""wow!"" The crepe-yness was nowhere in sight and my cheeks looked as fresh as when I'd applied in the morning at 7a. In fact, I usually smooth the excess moisturizer over my hands and looked at my hands as well. They looked smooth and creamy rather than dry and crepe-y! This is definitely a keeper. I will probably use both alternating between fall/winter and spring/summer."
5,CA,2011-01-07,Best facial cream I've ever used!,,"Light-textured, keep my skin very moist but not sticky or greasy, even small amount of cream does the job, I love this product!"
5,"Austin, TX",2010-12-10,the BEST moisture cream :),,"I have tried a lot of different moisture creams, but they didn't come close to Ultra Facial Cream. I recently tried the Sodium PCA Cream, which is really nice also, but it was too light for me.
This one is not too oily or too light, it's just right :)
No wonder this cream is world-famous!
I'm going back to this one as soon as I finish the Sodium PCA."
5,SK,2010-12-05,Best for dry skin,,"I would say this is the best cream for dry skin. Nothing more to say. It's just PERFECT. However, it can be too heavy for oily skin. I think Clinique will work better for you, if your skin is olily."
4,Sunny South Florida,2010-11-20,Good basic product,,"If you want a good moisturizer, without all the fuss, this is for you. I use this when I'm sticking around the house and don't need a moisturizer that's working double duty as a sunblock. It's great for all over and provides moisture for your eyes, ears (don't forget about them) and neck. Great product to have on hand while traveling, and need a little extra moisture after being on a plane or exposed to a different climate. Also, frequently available as a Kiehl's sample or gift with purchase in the little glass jars, making it easily refillable!"
5,"West Lafayette, IN",2010-11-18,Great for my neck too!,,"I ordered this because I also have the bottle Ultra Facial Lotion and I use them together. I have concerns about my neck as I am now in my 50's and would like to keep the skin supple in that area, and this product works well for me. I apply it first and then put on the Ultra Facial Lotion (SPF 15) over it. The feeling it gives me all over is soothing and silky. I highly recomment."

5,DC Meto area,2010-10-12,The Go To Facial Cream,,I have a T-zone complexion and use the oil-free Ultra Facial Cream on clean skin underneath my makeup. I've tried many brands of facial moisturizers and Kiehl's is my staple. I do NOT have sensitive skin but prefer unscented makeup. The creamy texture of this product is another thing I love about it.
5,"Alpharetta, GA",2010-10-12,Great facial cream!,,"I love this facial/neck cream. I use it AM and PM. You don't have to use a lot and it soaks in well, not greasy at all. Foundation goes on well over it. My skin was feeling dry, even here in the humid south, and it's done a good job re-hydrating it. I also use the eye cream w/ avocado and like that too. Also hydrates well and you don't have to use a lot. I'm very happy with both and especially love this facial cream. Light, fluffy and moisturizing."
5,Alabama,2010-10-12,"Surprise, I can put a cream on my face!",,"It is so thick and creamy, but I can still put it on my face without feeling greasy. I was totally surprised at how well it absorbed and how soft my skin felt, even after one or two uses.

5,,2010-09-19,great for sensitive skin,,"I'm 38 and have always had trouble finding a face cream for my very sensitive skin. Kiehl's ultra facial cream has been my best find in years - it's not greasy, doesn't clog my pores, and soothes irritation. My skin is too sensitive to apply sunscreen directly, but if I apply sunscreen over this product it protects my skin from those irritants as well."
5,"Pensacola, FL",2010-09-04,Calms the Redness,,"I have very sensitive skin. I don't like fragrance in my products and I must get results. This Ultra Facial Cream delivers.

I have not always been able to say that with other products. Good Stuff."
